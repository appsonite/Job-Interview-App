This is a question to test your reasoning. Lets say your city has a population of 1 million. You estimate that 10% of the propulation drink beer every week. This leaves 100 000 people. You also estimate that each person drinks 4 beer a week. That gives approximately 400 000 bottles of beer a week. You can change the estimates, however the important part is to show your reasoning.

There are 300 million people in the US, and let's say 50% of them live in a house, at 3 people per house on average. So there are 50 million houses in the US. Each house gets repainted every 10 years on average, so 5 million houses get painted each year. Each house takes 5 days so each house painter can paint say 20 houses per year (since you can't paint during the winter, and also many painters do it just as a summer job).
The cost of renting Central Park should be equal to the annual operational cost plus a profit margin equal or higher than the most presticious real estate object in the city.
Each house takes 5 days so each house painter can paint say 20 houses per year (since you can't paint during the winter, and also many painters do it just as a summer job).5 million houses get painted each year and each painter does 20, so there are about 250,000 house painters .

Start with the Japanese population which is approx 120 million. Each person cuts their hair every two month. 120 divided on 6 = 20 million haircuts a year. Assume the average hair cutting salon has 5 hair cutters. Each hair cutter can cut 8 people a day. Each hair salon can then cut 40 people a day. 40 haircuts times 300 business days = 12 000 haircuts a year for each salon. Then Japan needs 20 million  / 12 000 = 1667. You can round this to 1500.
Taxi, because it can usually gets me faster from A to B.
Start both hour glasses at the same time. When the four minute hour glass is finished turn it over. When the seven minute hour glass is over turn it over.

Examples are doorstop, to kick or punch at karate show, to slide behind the wheel of a truck in a hill, to prop up a chair with a broken leg, for construction workers to sit on while on break. 
You have six possibilities on each dice (1-6). You have six times six possible combinations, which is 36. You have three options of making 11 or more: two sixes, one six and one five, one five and one six. Three divided on thirtysix is about 8.3%. 
Give it your best shot. :)
You wouldn´t, a new word would not be in the dictionary.
Look around in the room, see how many lightbulbs are in the room you are at. Estimate the number of rooms. Multiply the number of rooms with the number of lightbulbs.
Give it your best shot. :)
If the trucks were situated togheter, then you would transfer fuel from one truck to the others every two miles (100miles divided on 50 trucks). You would then get the sum of that which can be the summation of n=1 to n=50 for 100/n (100/50 + 100/49 + ...etc) which is approx 450 miles. If the trucks were situated 100 miles apart, the reach would be 5000 miles.
Turn on switch A for 1 minute. Turn it off. Turn on switch B. Enter the room with the bulbs.The dark hot bulb is A. The lit bulb is B. The dark, cold bulb is C.
Well, would you?
Total number of possible combinations are 19 x 25 = 475. Probability is equal to 2/475 = less than 0.5%.
Both words have two o´s. If you put a match two both of them, they would burn easy.
I would take off my clothes, jam it in between the blade and wall. Then I would wait til the electrical engine would shortcut, and I would take my clothes, make a rope and climb out.
